## What it Does 

### Problem Statement 
Today's AI tools are scattered, don't work together, and often compromise your privacy. You need one tool for emails, another for finances, and they never remember what you talked about before. Most importantly, you have no control over how your personal data is used.

### Hushh's Solution 

- **Smart AI Agents That Work Together**  
  Six specialized AI assistants that share context and work as a team to help you get things done.

- **Your Data Stays Private**  
  Everything is encrypted and you control what data each agent can access. No surprises, no hidden data collection.

- **Intelligent and Personalized**  
  Our agents learn your preferences and get better at helping you over time, while respecting your privacy.
