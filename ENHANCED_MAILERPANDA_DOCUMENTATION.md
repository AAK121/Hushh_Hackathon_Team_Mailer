## HushMCP Consent Scopes

### Required Scopes

| Operation | Required Scopes | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Content Generation | `VAULT_READ_EMAIL`, `CUSTOM_TEMPORARY` | Read existing campaigns, temporary AI processing |

### Consent Token Structure

```python
{
    'email_token': 'HCT:...',      # VAULT_READ_EMAIL
    'file_token': 'HCT:...',       # VAULT_READ_FILE  
    'write_token': 'HCT:...',      # VAULT_WRITE_EMAIL
    'temp_token': 'HCT:...'        # CUSTOM_TEMPORARY
}
```

## API Usage

### Basic Email Campaign

```python
POST /agents/mailerpanda
